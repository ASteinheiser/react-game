## Where we are going
To start, I think the game needs a thoughtful rebalance.

If we make leveling more meaningful, we could offer a stat point on level up that the player can distribute. This would also create the need for more stat values.

Instead of just an attack stat, maybe we have dexterity and magic stats too? Along with magic, we should have magic defense and mana. Attack should also be renamed to "Strength". With new stats, we should offer different weapon types.

Strength, dexterity and magic values should be used to calculate damage with the different weapon types. And maybe some weapons use a hybrid of 2 values, so the player would be incentivized to distribute points to more than just 1 stat.

Certain weapons should use mana when it's available for a ranged magic attack, howver if there is no mana, they should perform a melee attack at close range using only their stength for damage isntead of magic and anything else.

At this rate, there should be a class system. At around level 10 or so, the player advances and chooses a class that offers them a passive ability tree. I feel like this would help create an end game goal.

The ability tree should have things like weapon mastery (more damage with specific weapon type), mana or hp regen passives, special class abilities (maybe the mage can teleport before they take fatal damage, warrior can go rage mode with low hp, etc.).

In addition to the gameplay changes, it would be nice to revamp the animations and sounds across the game. Story mode could use a more compelling story as well and maybe some more maps.
